  abstract: >-
    This research develops a framework for forecasting AI
    incidents to help predict future risks. We have developed
    two models that forecasts incidents which include
    calibrated 90% prediction intervals with backtests. These
    models predicts a large growth in the total number of
    incidents over the next five years. This has generated
    forecasts with quantified uncertainty, enabling
    policymakers to shift from reactive to proactive risk
    mitigation, supporting evidence-based regulation and
    AI deployment.
