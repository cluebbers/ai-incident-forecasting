## Forecasting real-world AI failures before they happen

This site documents the **AI Incident Forecasting** project developed during the Apart AI Forecasting Hackathon.

We build statistical models on the AI Incident Database to:
- Forecast future AI incident counts
- Break forecasts down by risk domain and category
- Quantify uncertainty using calibrated prediction intervals
- Compare performance against naive baselines
