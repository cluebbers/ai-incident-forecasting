## Acknowledgements

We thank Apart Research for hosting the [AI Forecasting Hackathon](https://apartresearch.com/sprints/the-ai-forecasting-hackathon-2025-10-31-to-2025-11-02) that initiated this project. Apart Labs assisted in funding and supporting the research, without which this work would not have been possible. Thank you to all organisers, judges who provided insightful feedback on our initial draft, and the community for an incredibly collaborative event.
Thanks to the [Responsible AI Collaborative](https://raicollab.org/) for curating the AI Incident Database.
